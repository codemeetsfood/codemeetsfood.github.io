* Grind all the cashew nuts, fennel seeds,Cardamon and 1.5 tablespoon of dry fenugreek leaves to fine powder with a grinder/blender.
* Add red onions to the above powder, and this time grind again to a fine paste, add little water if needed, it should now have turned pale green.

### <a name="step-2"></a> Step 2 - Marinate:
* Take the washed chicken in a marination bowl
* Add the following, and mix them well

	* 1/2 Tablespoon of oil, 
	* Lemon juice
	* Salt to taste
* Set it aside for atleast 15 minutes upto 3 hours, the longer the better.

### <a name="step-3"></a> Step 3 - Bake:
**NOTE**: Can start cooking now, and can do this step in parallel, as we will be needing this only at the end.

* Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF
* Grease the foiled oven pan with remaining 1/2 Tablespoon of oil, place all the above marianted chicken breasts from [step 2](#step-2).
* Start the oven and let it cook for 20 minutes (ie unitl about 80% cooked).
* Remove the pan from the pan and let it cool down.
* After the cooked chicken completely cools down, cut it into 1 - 2 inch pieces, set it aside. 

## Directions:
* Heat the cooking pan on medium flame and add 2 Tablespoon of butter
* Add remaining 1 Tablespoon of ginger garlic paste, saute it under color changes.
* Transfer the grinded paste from [step 1](#step-1) to pan, saute it. 
* Add 1/2 tablespoon of salt, continue sauting on medium heat.
* After cooking for 8-10 minutes, while still on medium heat, transfer canned tomatoes tin to the pan, let it boil for 8-10 more minutes.
* Once this starts boiling, add below ingrediants and let it cook on medium flame with lid closed, stir it every 10 minutes, for 20 minutes.
	* half cup (~120ml) of cooking cream,
	* 1/2 Teaspoon of turmeric powder, 
	* 1/2 Teaspoon of chilli powder, 
	* 1/2 Teaspoon of garam masala powder, 
	* 1/2 Teaspoon  of coriander powder.
* Now add 
	* up to another half cup of cooking cream, 
	* 2 table spoon of butter, 
	* 1/3 cup of water.
* Let it cook for another 40 minutes with lid closed, saute every 10 minutes. (Now is a good time to procced to [step 3](#step-3))
* Almost there, now add 
	* more water based on the consistency (should be loose at this point)
	* 1/2 Tablespoon of powdered dry fenugreek leaves,
	* 2 tablespoon of butter (optional),
	* 1/2 Teaspoon of sugar (optional),  
	* if needed add more cream based on tanginess of tomatoes (you probably have to), 
* Let the pan boil without the lid, from now on, for another 10-15 mins, stir every 5 mins.
* Add the cut chicken cubes from [step 3](#step-3) and let it boil for another 10 mins with lid open.
* Once the consistency is reached, turn off the stove, garnish with some chopped corianders, close it with lid.
